Idea>>>
    I wanted to create something holiday themed I, learned to make the famous koch snowflake and wanted to make a program that would draw it in random places to create a 'snowing' effect


Approach>>>
    dictionary color pallete>>>>
        1. Inspired by santas naughty list I decided to change christmas snow based on if the user was good, bad, or ehh
        2. used a dictionary to house 3 different lists of different color palletes for each snowflake to be everytime a snowflake was drawn
        3.Got user input and depending on the user input a color pallete would be selected from the dictionary and used to draw the snowflakes 
        4.entering 'good' would make the pallete blue, cyan & white
        5.entering 'ehh' would make the pallete white
        6. entering 'bad' or anything else would make the pallete red, yellow, and orange

    Koch snowflake>>>>
        1. A koch snowflake is a triangle where it's sides form smaller triangles, this pattern of triangles forming on sides goes on and on.
        2.Used recursive function 'flake()' to draw a side of the snowflake, it would emulate this 'triangle with triangle sides' pattern. Would repeat the pattern 3 times and turn left each time to complete the snowflake

    Random coords>>>>
        1. used a random number generate for both x and y coordinates
        (350 is max, -175 is min) this creates a range of coordinates to be chosen randomly
        2. I order the turtle to go to the chosen coordinates each time a koch snowflake is drawn

    Random form>>>>
        1. I wanted to make each snowflake random and vary in size and length 
        2.Used a random number generator with a range of 50-25 for the length 
        3.Used a random number generator with a range of 4-2 for the depth

    drawing snowflakes>>>>
        felt like there should only be 15 snowflakes as it was a 
        good middle number that would prevent crashing but also allow good aesthetic appearance
        1. Used all the variables generated by random
        
    christmas tree>>>>
        1. For a more holiday feel I decided to draw a christmas tree
        2. Created as specific function to draw the tree 
        3.commanding the turtle itself to go forward, back, or turn to draw the layers and the stem of the tree
        4. Result is an outline of the tree with it's respective green and brown colors 

    return>>>>
        1. After program is finnished drawing it's 15 snowflakes it will print out the number of times the flake function was called


Koch snowflake conditions>>>
     1.For depth it felt like a good range was 2-4 since over than 4 would be too complicated(10 would most certainly crash the program) and take too long to draw and less than 2 is way too simple and not 'cool' enough
     2.Length I tried to keep 25-50 so that it won't take too long to draw each individual snowflake since we were drawing 15 and that one wouldn't take up too much of the screen
     3.Try to keep the length relative to the screen size(400 by 400)
    

possible bugs>>>
    Although there isn't really a chance for the user to crash the program since the input is so limited there are times where a snowflake can be drawn partially out of the window or times where multiple snowflakes clutter in a singular spot
